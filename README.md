# Lua Programming Concepts

This is the host page for the Lua Programming Concepts thread on the Developer Forum, the introduction thread was already posted there, but this wont be used for future threads
as I believe its better to maintain things here where we can argue on what goes in each section. Each addition to the book overall will be sent as a pull request, and we can debate it there.

The introduction thread post will be changed as well.

# Collaborating

I'll submit different parts of the book as pull requests as we need to. The structure of the repository wont be debated as I have a more concrete shape for that

```
- pages
  - chapters.md
  - markdown documents for each page
```
