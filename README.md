# Luau Programming Concepts

This is the host repository for a book I'm writing called "Luau Programming Concepts", I'm doing it like this because I want feedback on how to approach it rather than going in head-first.
Notable collaborators will be included in the book in the foreword chapter.

# Collaborating

I'll submit different parts of the book as pull requests as we need to. The structure of the repository wont be debated as I have a more concrete shape for that, feel free to debate
or request changes on the sections that are currently in the pull request phase.

```
- pages
  - chapters.md
